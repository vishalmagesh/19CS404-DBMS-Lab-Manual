# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is EQUAL TO $1500.
Sample table: CUSTOMERS
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS    | SALARY |
|----|----------|-----|------------|--------|
| 1  | Ramesh   | 32  | Ahmedabad  | 2000   |
| 2  | Khilan   | 25  | Delhi      | 1500   |
| 3  | Kaushik  | 23  | Kota       | 2000   |
| 4  | Chaitali | 25  | Mumbai     | 6500   |
| 5  | Hardik   | 27  | Bhopal     | 8500   |
| 6  | Komal    | 22  | Hyderabad  | 4500   |
| 7  | Muffy    | 24  | Indore     | 10000  |

```sql
select * from customers 
where salary = 1500;
```

**Output:**

| phone       | INTEGER   |

```sql
select * from customer 
where city not in (
select city from customer 
where id = (select max(id) from customer));
```
