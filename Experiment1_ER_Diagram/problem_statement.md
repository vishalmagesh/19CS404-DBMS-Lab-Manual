# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Entities and Attributes:

**Student**

Attributes: StudentID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Email, PhoneNumber, EnrollmentDate, DepartmentID.

**Faculty**

Attributes: FacultyID, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber, HireDate, DepartmentID.

**Department**

Attributes: DepartmentID, DepartmentName, Location.

**Course**

Attributes: CourseID, CourseName, CourseCode, Credits, DepartmentID.

**Enrollment**

Attributes: EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate, Grade.

**Class**

Attributes: ClassID, CourseID, FacultyID, Semester, Year, Schedule.

**Advising**

Attributes: AdvisingID, StudentID, FacultyID, AdvisingDate.

## Relationships and Constraints:

**Student–Advising–Faculty:**

Relationship: Advises Cardinality: Many-to-Many (each student can have multiple advisors, each faculty can advise multiple students) Participation: Total on Advising

**Student–Enrollment–Course**

Relationship: Enrolled in Cardinality: Many-to-Many Participation: Total on Enrollment

**Course–Class–Faculty:**

Relationship: Teaches Cardinality: Many-to-Many (each course can be taught in multiple classes, each faculty can teach multiple classes)

**Course–Department:**

Relationship: Offered by Cardinality: Many-to-One (Each course belongs to one department)

**Student–Department:**

Relationship: Belongs to Cardinality: Many-to-One

**Faculty–Department:**

Relationship: Belongs to Cardinality: Many-to-One

**Class–Course:**

Relationship: Includes Cardinality: Many-to-One

**Enrollment–Class:**

Relationship: Taught by Not standard; assumes indirect mapping via faculty

## Extension (Prerequisite / Billing):
Prerequisite Modeling:
Could be modeled with a recursive relationship on Course: Relationship: Requires Cardinality: Many-to-Many (a course can have many prerequisites and be a prerequisite for many others)

## Design Choices:
Use of separate entities for Advising, Enrollment, and Class helps normalize many-to-many relationships and maintain relational integrity. Department as a central entity provides a logical way to group students, faculty, and courses.

Class entity includes scheduling details, separating course content from the time/location of delivery.

The design is modular and supports easy extension for future requirements like prerequisites, billing, or attendance.

## RESULT
Thus, the Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram have been created successfully.
